[Play the game on itch.io](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper)

Welcome to the bugscraper.
Here, nefarious insects and pests all around the world come to plan their next mischief. 
Stop them before it is too late!

Rise to the top of a bug-infested tower by fighting on an elevator. On each floor, waves of enemies will come for your skin (or rather, exoskeleton). With your trusty pea gun, eliminate them and prepare for the next floor!
