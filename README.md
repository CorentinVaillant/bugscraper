Welcome to the bugscraper.
Here, nefarious insects and pests all around the world come to plan their next mischief. 
Stop them before it is too late!

Rise to the top of a bug-infested tower by fighting on an elevator. On each floor, waves of enemies will come for your skin (or rather, exoskeleton). With your trusty pea gun, eliminate them and prepare for the next floor!

## Running & contributing
To run the game, please follow the instructions on the [LÖVE Getting started page](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).   
To export the game, please look into [Makelove](https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove).   
Please note that I was in highschool when I began this project. I wrote the code mostly for myself and I did not always plan for the future or make the best code design choices. The code is almost not documented. You have been warned. For any questions you can [contact me](https://yolwoocle.com/about).

## Distribution
Please feel free to reuse, modify, or remix the source code of the game for any non commercial project.   
If it is commercial please [contact me first](https://yolwoocle.com/about) (I'll probably say yes!).   
I am very lax with what you can do with the source code, but please note that I reserve all rights of the original work (just in case).

## Can I pirate your game?
I don't care. I'm not here to tell you what you should do. I've pirated games as a kid myself. I'm making this game for my own enjoyment, and I don't financially depend on it.

This isn't about me, but you: by choosing to buy or pirate a game, you are judging whether you are financially capable of affording it, and whether you are willing, or capable, of supporting the developer. Making games is difficult. People pour their soul and heart into providing enjoyment to others, often with very little gains. It is a work of love. When you buy a game, you also expressing your gratitude towards that work. 

So you decide. 🙂
