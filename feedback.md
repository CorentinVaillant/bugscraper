# Input
- Aiming using a joystick is too sensitive

# Character
- Monsters might feel like bullet sponges given starting gun has 25 bullets. Got some kind of shotgun in round 2 and bullets were same size but maybe felt like the had increased damage? Cant tell visually. // (Rapsberry shotgun and pea shooter)
- Can jump and shoot with pea gun at same time to get super boost to ceiling which i havent yet managed to do with the minigun or triple shooter.
- Stomping can feel confusing visually, the mechanics appear to be if player is falling down then you kill enemy even if inside their hitbox but if you have any upwards movement then you take damage. If going for a series of drops, especially against the grasshoppers can be really hard to avoid taking damage.
- feels like optimal strategy is to avoid guns and just jump on enemies. Get good at that and you kill everything faster than a good ever could 
  - except spiders, always have to shoot them.

# Gun
- Berry gun (circular arc gun) is hard to use, esp against snails
- Wish there was a way to switch weapons
- Gun variability seems good, though not always predictable.
  
# Loot
- Wish you didn't accidentally collect guns
- Drops feel random and not for any sense of achievement (might be wrong here, just feels like random chance so doesnt matter if I am doing well or poorly)

# Enemies
- Slugs rapidly flipping left & right feels unnatural
- Grasshoppers are really hard esp for new players and with their off-cycle jumps and given that wall jumping is the only way to really avoid them (standard gun doesn't have neough kb or damage to handle them)
- Spiders on earlier floors often feel too hard to get drop/fall kill which has been only way to get combo kill so far. Guns dont seem to kill fast enough to achieve it. 
  - Its because the spiders stick to the middle section unless you shoot them, and if you are shooting them why bother jumping on them.

# Combo
- ???: Combos dont carry over due to timer on it, feels harsh when doing clean sweep on a level of killing enemies without taking a hit and even timing them becoming active from the lift and jumping on all the next ones. Would feel nicer maybe if combo counter was maybe just kills without damage? Or preserves over level for a short while to incentivise fast killing strats.

# Level
- The battle arena (the lift) did feel a little barren after a while as it doesnt change or adapt and provides no additional strategies (as only two side walls to jump off).

# UI
- And minor thing on pause menu, when tapping down to select options felt like o was doing same distance but wasnt wuite causing menu to go down so felt sticky and unresponsive sometimes.

# Suggestions
- SUGGESTION: after death the retry button takes you to main screen where you have to smash the button again to start again. Maybe two options for wuick restart then the main menu screen, if you want to do some rapid levels back-toback.

# Bugs
- BUG: pollen gun might have a bug so you end up firing extra shots when rapidly clicking. Meant of the 30 shots, would end up with 1 or 2 bullets left in chamber, i would fire and then the last shot or two would fire and reloading. It also seems to have a period of sometimes halting so squeezing trigger would not fire.
- BUG: And one game crash, went to credits and pressed confirm while on Louie Chapman and game froze.
